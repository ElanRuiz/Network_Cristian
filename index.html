        <h1>Non-terrestrial Network (NTN)</h1>
        <p>The introduction of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) in 3GPP standards
            will revolutionize wireless communications by integrating terrestrial
            cellular networks with satellite communications. Mobile network
            operators (MNOs) want to expand their fifth-generation (5G) and
            eventually sixth-generation (6G) cellular networks and infrastructure
            while delivering more bandwidth. Government and military agencies
            want advancements like enhanced imaging and improved security
            from the new generation of satellite technologies.</p>
            <img src="Ntn.png" alt="Logo de HTML5">
        <p>An NTN is a network that includes nodes not physically located on Earth.
            Although we think primarily of satellites in NTNs, other components can
            consist of low-altitude platforms / drones (LAP), high-altitude pseudo
            satellites / drones / balloons (HAPS), satellites across the various orbits,
            and combinations of these.</p>
        <p>The Figure above illustrates NTN space-borne and aerial communication networks
            operating across the geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit
            (GEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and low Earth orbit (LEO)</p>
        <h3>Tipos de NTN incluyen:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Geostationary Equatorial Orbit GEO</li>
            <p>Geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) satellites are 
                a cornerstone of non-terrestrial networks (NTN), especially in the context 
                of global communications. Positioned approximately 35,786 kilometers 
                above the Earth's equator, GEO satellites orbit at the same rotational 
                speed as the Earth, effectively remaining in a fixed position relative 
                to the ground. This unique characteristic makes GEO satellites ideal for 
                applications requiring stable, continuous coverage over large geographic 
                areas, such as broadcasting, weather monitoring, and certain military 
                operations.

                One of the primary advantages of GEO satellites is their ability to provide 
                long-duration, fixed connections. Because they maintain a constant position 
                in the sky, large parabolic antennas on the ground can be pointed directly 
                at a single satellite, creating robust data channels with minimal need for
                 reorientation. This stability is particularly beneficial for applications
                  that demand reliable, high-throughput communication links, such as satellite
                   television and long-distance telephony.
                
                However, the high altitude of GEO satellites introduces significant challenges,
                 most notably in terms of latency. The considerable distance between the
                  satellite and the Earth's surface leads to a delay in signal transmission, 
                  which can be exacerbated by the number of hops a signal must make between 
                  satellites and ground stations. For instance, in a scenario where a signal
                   travels from a remote location to a news studio via a GEO satellite,
                    the round-trip latency can be easily noticeable to viewers as
                     correspondents experience delays in their exchanges.</p>
            <li>Low Earth Orbit LEO</li>
            <p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites represent a critical innovation in
                 non-terrestrial networks (NTN), particularly for applications
                  that demand low-latency and resilient communication links. Orbiting
                   at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 kilometers above the Earth,
                    LEO satellites operate at speeds of approximately 17,000 miles per
                     hour. This high velocity, coupled with their proximity to the
                      Earth's surface, allows LEO satellites to deliver significantly
                       lower latency compared to their geostationary (GEO) counterparts.
                        This makes them particularly well-suited for real-time applications
                         such as broadband internet, IoT connectivity, and certain defense
                          and intelligence operations.

                One of the primary advantages of LEO satellites is
                 their ability to reduce latency in communications
                  due to the shorter distance signals must travel between
                   the satellite and ground stations. This proximity enables 
                   quicker data transmission, which is crucial for applications 
                   where even minimal delays can impact performance, such as in 
                   remote sensing, video conferencing, and autonomous vehicle 
                   coordination.</p>
            <li>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)</li>
            <p>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites occupy a unique position within
                 non-terrestrial networks (NTN), offering a balance between the 
                 low-latency benefits of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and the 
                 expansive coverage of Geostationary (GEO) satellites. Positioned 
                 at altitudes ranging from approximately 2,000 to 35,786 kilometers 
                 above Earth, MEO satellites are strategically utilized for applications 
                 that require a compromise between latency, coverage, and network resilience.

                One of the key advantages of MEO satellites is their ability to cover 
                larger areas than LEO satellites while still maintaining relatively 
                low latency compared to GEO satellites. This makes MEO orbits particularly 
                effective for global navigation systems like GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS, 
                where accurate positioning and timing are crucial. The moderate altitude 
                allows these satellites to provide broad coverage with fewer satellites 
                than would be required in a LEO constellation, while still offering 
                better latency performance than GEO satellites.</p>

        <h2>6G</h2>
        <p>The race for 6G supremacy is on, with the US, Europe, and China each pursuing 
            their own strategies and making significant strides in this next-generation 
            wireless technology. The Sixth Generation (6G) of wireless communications 
            represents the next evolutionary step following the widespread standardization 
            of 5G networks. 6G aims to achieve unprecedented levels of flexibility to 
            accommodate emerging applications and diverse requirements that surpass the 
            capabilities of current systems. This enhanced flexibility will be realized 
            through improved awareness utilizing advanced sensing mechanisms and 
            Artificial Intelligence (AI), a richer set of technological options, 
            and optimized adaptation strategies based on practical sensing capabilities. 
            Building upon the foundations laid by previous generations, particularly 
            the multidimensional resource utilization of 4G and the initial flexibility 
            strides of 5G, 6G will necessitate a comprehensive redesign of cellular 
            communications infrastructure. The ultimate goal is to develop an ultra-flexible 
            framework that seamlessly integrates various key enabling technologies and 
            concepts, thereby meeting the complex and dynamic demands of future wireless 
            communication landscapes.</p>
